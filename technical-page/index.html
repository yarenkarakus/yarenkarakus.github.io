            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to
            structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
            structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
            using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article
            will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
            content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to
            enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a
            word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can
            make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the
            following line of content:
          </p>
          <code><xmp>My cat is very grumpy</xmp></code>
          <p>
            If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
            is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
          </p>
          <code>
            <xmp><p>My cat is very grumpy</p></xmp>
          </code>
          <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
          <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
              alt="Anatomy of HTML"
            />
            <figcaption>
              The main parts of our element are as follows:
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">The opening tag: </span>This consists of the
              name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
              closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or
              starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">The closing tag: </span>This is the same as the
              opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
              element name. This states where the element ends — in this case
              where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of
              the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">The content: </span>This is the content of the
              element, which in this case, is just text.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">The element: </span>he opening tag, the closing
              tag, and the content together comprise the element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
              alt="Attribute"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that you
            don't want to appear in the actual content. Here,
            <code>class</code> is the attribute name and
            <code> editor-note</code> is the attribute value. The
            <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element a
            non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other
            elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style
            information and other things.
          </p>
          <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A space between it and the element name (or the previous
              attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>
              The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="Note">
            <strong>Note: </strong>Simple attribute values that don't contain
            ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters <code>" ' ` = < ></code>)
            can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all
            attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and
            understandable.
          </p>
          <h2>Nesting elements</h2>
          <p>
            You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
            nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
            wrap the word "very" in a
            <code><a href="#strong">strong</a></code> element, which means that
            the word is to be strongly emphasized:
          </p>
          <code>
            <xmp><p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p></xmp>
          </code>
          <p>
            The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are
            clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown
            above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what
            you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So
            don't do it!
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header>Images</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position
            it appears. It does this via the
            <code>src (source)</code> attribute, which contains the path to our
            image file. We have also included an
            <code> alt (alternative) </code>attribute. In the alt attribute, you
            specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image,
            possibly because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual
              impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the
              alt text to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For
              example, try deliberately changing the path inside your
              <code> src</code>
              attribute to make it incorrect.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you
            write should provide the reader with enough information to have a
            good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current
            text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative
            for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox
            surrounding the Earth."
          </p>
          <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
        <header>Marking up Text</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for
            marking up the text.
          </p>
          <h2>Headings</h2>
          <p>
            Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your
            content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book
            has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document
            can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, h1 - h6, although you'll
            commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
          </p>
          <code>
            <xmp>
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
            </xmp>
          </code>
          <p class="Note">
            <strong>Note: </strong>Anything in HTML between &lt;!-- and --&gt;
            is an HTML comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the
            code. In other words, they are not visible on the page - just in the
            code. HTML comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about
            your code or logic.
          </p>
          <h2>Lists</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements
            for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.
            The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't
              matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a ul
              element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does
              matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an ol element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following
            paragraph fragment into a list
          </p>
          <code>
            <xmp>
<ul>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>
<p>working together…</p>
            </xmp>
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Links">
        <header>Links</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add
            a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the
            short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a
            link, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Netflix".</li>
            <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt element, as shown below:</li>
            <code>
              <xmp
>
<a>Netflix</a>
              </xmp>
            </code>
            <li>
              Give the &lt;a&gt element an href attribute, as shown below:
            </li>
            <code>
              <xmp>
<a href="">Netflix</a>
              </xmp>
            </code>
            <li>
              Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you
              want the link to:
            </li>
            <code>
              <xmp>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">
  Netflix
</a> 
              </xmp>
            </code>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http://
            part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address.
            After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where
            you wanted it to.
          </p>
          <p class="Note">
            <strong>Note: </strong>href might appear like a rather obscure
            choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble
            remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.
